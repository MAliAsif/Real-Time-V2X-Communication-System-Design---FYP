# 🚗 Real-Time V2X Communication System

A final-year capstone project focused on designing and developing a **Real-Time Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communication System** using **LoRa** protocol, enabling seamless vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication without the need for cellular or Wi-Fi infrastructure.

## 🧠 Project Summary

This system enhances road safety and traffic efficiency by enabling:
- Direct **V2V communication** driver safety and connectivity and **DSR Protocol** implementation for Dynamic Network configuration of nodes
- Real-time **Traffic congestion monitoring** via RSU (Roadside Unit) Node
- OFDM based Backhaul link for future usecases.
